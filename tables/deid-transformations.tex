\textbf{Tactic name} & \textbf{Description}                                                                                                                                                          \\ \hline
Remove               & The targeted and deliberate omission of PII from the data record or data set.                                                                                                 \\
Select / Filter      & Same as Remove applied to a copy of the data while keeping the original data.                                                                                                 \\
Transform            & The application of a holistic transformation (not targeted on PII elements only) on data elements that is destructive in terms of ability to distinguish these data elements. \\
Mask                 & Overwriting data elements with other values for the purpose of obfuscating the content.                                                                                       \\
Encrypt              & Using cryptographic means to encode the PII attribute values / records / datasets.                                                                                            \\
Randomize            & Tactics that involve the modification of PII attribute values/records by injecting artificial random elements.                                                                \\
Aggregate            & Generalize, combine and group data elements.                                                                                                                                  \\
Blur                 & Reduce the accuracy of the data so that distinguishing characteristics become indiscernible.                                                                                  \\
Pseudonym            & The systematic replacement of direct identifiers with surrogates, whereby the mapping between surrogate and identity is kept separately.                                      \\
Placeholder          & The systematic replacement of direct identifiers with a surrogate that is the same for all members of the population.                                                         \\
Interchange          & The targeted mingling of data elements across members of the population.                                                                                                      \\
Synthetic            & The replacement of data elements with a synthetic placeholder which is a constructed representation specifically aimed at conveying discriminatory features.
